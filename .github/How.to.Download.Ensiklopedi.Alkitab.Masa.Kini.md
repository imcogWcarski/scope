If you want to download EAMK for your personal study or research, you have several options. Here are some of them:
 
- You can visit the website of Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia (PNRI), the national library of Indonesia, and search for EAMK in their online catalog. You will find three copies of EAMK available for borrowing or reading on site. You can also request a digital copy of EAMK from PNRI by filling out a form and paying a fee. The website of PNRI is [https://opac.perpusnas.go.id/](https://opac.perpusnas.go.id/).
- You can use the YouVersion Bible app on your smartphone or tablet and access EAMK as one of the Bible versions in Indonesian language. You can read EAMK online or offline, as well as compare it with other versions, highlight verses, take notes, and share your insights with others. The YouVersion Bible app is free and can be downloaded from [https://www.bible.com/app](https://www.bible.com/app).
- You can buy a hard copy of EAMK from YKBK or other online bookstores and scan it yourself using a scanner or a mobile app. You can then convert the scanned images into a PDF file or an e-book format. This option may be more costly and time-consuming, but it will give you a physical copy of EAMK that you can keep or lend to others.

Whichever option you choose, we hope that EAMK will enrich your knowledge and understanding of the Bible and its message for today.
  
If you want to learn more about EAMK and its contents, you can also check out some of the reviews and articles that have been written about it. For example, you can read a review by Dr. Bambang Subiyanto, a lecturer at Sekolah Tinggi Teologi Jakarta (STTJ), who praises EAMK for its accuracy, clarity, relevance, and usefulness. He also suggests some areas for improvement, such as adding more entries on contemporary issues, updating some outdated information, and correcting some typographical errors. You can find his review at [https://sttjakarta.ac.id/ensiklopedi-alkitab-masa-kini/](https://sttjakarta.ac.id/ensiklopedi-alkitab-masa-kini/).
 
Another article that you can read is by Dr. Paulus Widjaja, a professor at Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana (UKDW), who compares EAMK with other Bible encyclopedias in Indonesian language, such as Ensiklopedia Alkitab (EA) and Ensiklopedia Alkitab Indonesia (EAI). He analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of each encyclopedia in terms of their scope, methodology, perspective, and presentation. He concludes that EAMK is the most comprehensive and balanced encyclopedia among the three, but he also acknowledges the contributions and limitations of each one. You can read his article at [https://www.ukdw.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ensiklopedia-Alkitab-Masa-Kini.pdf](https://www.ukdw.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ensiklopedia-Alkitab-Masa-Kini.pdf).
 
We hope that these resources will help you to appreciate EAMK as a valuable tool for studying the Bible and its context. We also encourage you to share EAMK with others who may benefit from it.
