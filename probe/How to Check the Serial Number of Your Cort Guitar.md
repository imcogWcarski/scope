## Where to Find the Serial Number
 
Cort model serial numbers are usually found on the back of the headstock of the guitar. Sometimes they are also located inside the soundhole on a label. The serial number can consist of six to nine digits, depending on the year and model of the guitar. The serial number can tell you the year, month, batch number, factory code, and production number of your guitar.
 
## How to Decode the Serial Number
 
The most common dating system for Cort guitars has been in place since around 2000 and is YYMMXXXX. Thus, a serial number reading 02046572 means the guitar was most likely manufactured in April 2002. In early 2005, Cort serial numbers gained an extra identification digit, and so some models manufactured after this date are in the style of YYMMXXXXX.
 
You can use a decoder tool online to enter your serial number and get detailed information about your guitar. One such tool is [Guitar Dater](http://www.guitarsdater.com/Dater), which can decode Cort guitars as well as other brands. Another option is [Authority Guitar](https://authorityguitar.com/guitar-serial-number-lookup/), which has a dedicated page for Cort guitars with examples and explanations.
 
## How to Spot a Fake
 
Unfortunately, there are some fake Cort guitars on the market that try to pass off as genuine ones. One way to spot a fake is to find an inconsistency between the serial number and the model or features of the guitar. For instance, a guitar with a serial number indicating a 2002 production date but with a newer design or hardware would likely be counterfeit.
 
Another giveaway can be discrepancies in the spacing or alignment of the numbers and letters on the headstock. A genuine Cort guitar should have a clear and consistent serial number stamp. A fake one might have uneven or crooked characters or gaps between them.
 
If you are unsure about the authenticity of your Cort guitar, you can always contact Cort customer service or visit their official website for more information. You can also check online forums and blogs for expert opinions and advice from other guitar enthusiasts.
